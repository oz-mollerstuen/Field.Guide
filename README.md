### Description
This Activity Tracker/AA tracking app is my Epicodus Capstone Project. It is not finished, but it will be in the future. 
I've learned a ton about project structuring and trying too hard to make a massive project when the MVP will do. My proposal for this project had to be changed halfway through in part, but here it is:
#
## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

* Allow users to log into their own account and keep lists of frequently attended meetings and locations, keep track of sober time, search for more meetings, find resources and more. One little app to fully track recovery.
#
## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Account log-in
* Create lists of meetings with information on ways to attend
* Calendar
#
## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* React
* .NET
* MySQL
* HTML
* Entity 6
* Firebase/Firebase Auth
#
## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Integrate API to find meetings in real time
*  Add alerts to notify you when a meeting is about to start
* Notepad
* Day counter
#
## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

 * Chakra-UI
 * style-loader
 * webpack
 * 
 #

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* _Clone the repository to your desktop from:_
``` 
https://github.com/oz-mollerstuen/Field.Guide.git
```
* _Create appsettings.json file in GalleryGramApp folder and paste the following in the file_
```
In future .env instructions will be listed here
```
* _run npm commands in root_
```
npm I
```
```
npm run build
```
```
npm run start
```
------------------------------

## Known Bugs
* Issues with Firebase causes edit/delete to crash code 
* Spacing and usage of calendar buttons don't work
* "Account" page does not work
* If you find a bug in my code please leave a message at [mollerstuen.works@gmail.com]

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />


## Learn More
